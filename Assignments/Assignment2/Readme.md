# Malware Assignment 
## Malware Assignment 1 - FooWorm.py
a. Taking cues from the code shown for AbraWorm.py in class, turn the FooVirus virus into a worm by incorporating networking code in it. 
b. The resulting worm will still infect not only the ‘.foo’ files, but it will also have the ability to hop into other machines.

## Malware Assignment 2 - AbraWormMod.py
a. Modify the code AbraWorm.pl code so that no two copies of the worm are exactly the same in all of the infected hosts at any given time. One way to accomplish this would be by inserting worm alteration code after the comment line that you see near the end of the main infinite loop in the script. Finally, deposit a copy of AbraWorm.pl at the target host: 
b. This additional code in the worm could insert some extra newline characters between a randomly chosen set of lines, some extra randomly selected characters in the comment blocks, some extra white space between the identifiers in each statement at randomly chosen places, and so on.

## Malware Assignment 3 - Optional - Assignment3_optional.py 
a. And if you are ambitious, you can get the worm to modify the code in more significant ways (without altering its overall logic) before depositing a copy of itself in a target host. · For example, since you can use different control structures for infinite loops, you could randomly choose from amongst a given set of possibilities for each new version of the worm. · The net result of all these changes on the fly will be that you will make it much harder for the worm to be recognized with simple signature based recognition algorithms.
